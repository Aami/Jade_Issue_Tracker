# Jade

Hai!

Jade is a Visual Novel where you are a boy named Jonathan and you wake up in a forest. It's awesome, isn't it?

I'm not sure about the story, but I think it would be a lot of dumb stuff, and maybe some romance. Isn't that cute?

It's been a while that I wanted to make a Visual Novel, even if it'll sucks or whatever. So, today, I decided to begin a Visual Novel! I hope you guys would like it when it'll come out!
